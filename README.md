The Sloth Engine is a 2D video game engine that I'm currently building. I enjoyed using Unity, so I thought I would deepen my understanding of what goes into an engine by creating my own that I can then use to create any 2D game I would like. 

It currently has full Entitys to be able to manipulate in the scene how ever you want with transforms, sprites, hitboxes, etc. Saving and loading maps is easy as a click of a button. It's been very handy for my artist to mock up levels and animations to use in our game, Vanthrok.
